### Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name.

The following code bundle contains a data generator which can be used to test the queries given in the book. However, since the data is randomly generated, not all queries will work as expected and you may have to modify them accordingly.

Accordingly the use of other files is mentioned, as and when needed, in individual chapters of the book.

None of the chapters have code files, all required support files are present in the bundle.

The code will look like the following:
```
sourcetype="impl_splunk_gen" ip="*"
| rex "ip=(?P<subnet>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\.\d+"
| table ip subnet
```

To start with the book, you will first need to download Splunk from https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html.
You can find the official installation manual at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements.
